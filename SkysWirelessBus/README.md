# Wireless Bus

Adds a component that wirelessly transmits signals. The signals are sent to all other wireless busses with the same name and number of pegs. Changing the text color does nothing except... change the text color.

The component is limited to 64 pegs, if you need more you can use multiple busses or make a custom component using the underlying IWireless interface.

Effectively a simpler version of RadioConnection by Ecconia but with named channels instead of numeric ID.

## Install Instructions

Just copy the LabelSockets folder into your GameData folder and launch the game.

Requires EccsLogicWorldAPI and EccsGuiBuilder which can be found on the LogicWorld Discord server.
