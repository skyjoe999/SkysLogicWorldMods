# Sky's Sockets

Allows for the creation of more than one socket interface per component. All of the functions for doing so are public so other mods can access them to make their own components.

Also adds a socket array component which is a dynamically sized line of sockets. If you do not want that component and only want the virtual socket api you can safely to delete the components folder.

## Install Instructions

Just copy the SkysSockets folder into your GameData folder and launch the game.



Requires EccsLogicWorldAPI, HarmonyForLogicWorld, AssemblyLoader and EccsGuiBuilder which can be found on the LogicWorld Discord server (all by Ecconia).
